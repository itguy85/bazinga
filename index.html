			<img src="images/bazinga.jpg" alt="BAZINGA" class="left" height="250" width="250" />Sheldon Lee Cooper,B.S., M.S., M.A., Ph.D., Sc.D. is a Caltech theoretical physicist who shares an apartment with his colleague and best friend, Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki). They live across the hallway from a highly sociable waitress named Penny (Kaley Cuoco), with whom Sheldon clashes due to her "free-loading" and un-organized lifestyle, even though he identifies her as one of his friends despite her lack of scientific education. The "free-loading" was involved in one of Sheldon's Wi-Fi passphrases (pennyisafreeloader). Sheldon exhibits a strict adherence to routine, a total lack of social skills, a tenuous understanding of irony, sarcasm, and humor, and a general lack of humility or empathy. He is vocal about his own superior intellect compared to those around him. These characteristics provide the bulk of his character's humor and the center of some. He has been described as the show's breakout character. Sheldon is usually characterized as extremely intelligent, socially awkward and rigidly logical. His very high IQ often seems to have created a superiority complex, but he also possesses childlike qualities, of which he seems unaware, such as extreme stubbornness.<br />
